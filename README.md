# Kattis Solutions

This repository contains [my](https://open.kattis.com/users/josht) solutions for problems on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/). There is also some solutions from programming competitions I did with the Univeristy of Prince Edward Island.

Each problem folder contains helper scripts for building and running the solution. These scripts are not checked into version control and are generated by the `new-problem.bat` script. Upon cloning or pulling  new changes from this repository, make sure to run the `regen-problems.bat` script, which will invoke `new-problem.bat` for every existing problem.
